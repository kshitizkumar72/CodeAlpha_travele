This is a basic Java program that prompts the user to input the number of destinations, the destinations themselves, start and end dates. Then it generates a simple itinerary with the provided information.

To enhance this program with additional features like maps, weather information, and budget calculations, you would need to integrate with external APIs or libraries that provide such functionality. For example:

Maps: You can use Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap API to display maps and directions between destinations.
Weather Information: You can use services like OpenWeatherMap API to get weather forecasts for each destination.
Budget Calculations: You can ask users for their budget and calculate expenses such as accommodation, transportation, and activities.
Integrating these features would require more advanced Java programming skills, as well as understanding how to interact with external APIs and handle JSON or XML data. You may also need to handle exceptions and errors gracefully in case there are issues with API calls or user input.
